specific\nweaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.\nI was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis\/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.\nIn collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the\naccounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.\nThis tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.\nI was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.\nI supported the USAFE\/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool\nthat provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to\nthe GPC.\nThis tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE\/FMA.\nThis tool provided the capability for USAFE\/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop\/deploy joint guidance that supports\nthe established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of\nfunds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.\nI identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.\nMy research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and\nDFAS personnel.\nThis not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.\nI partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.\nI identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in\nFMSuite.\nBy utilizing Defense Connect Online I provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)\ntravel.\nThe results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.\nCompany Name January 2007 to July 2009 Chief, Reports Branch.

errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS\/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were\naccomplished.\nI also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.\nLimestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a\nDirectorate which previously did not exist.\nMy challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial\nreporting was maintained.\nAs we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.\nI participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.\nWorked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.\nI was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously\nexist.\nLimestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.\nIdentified suspense accounts not initially targeted, formulated strategies to eliminate accounts or requested waivers, and participated in plans\nto modify processes using suspense accounts, such as the interfund suspense account.\nThese actions provided initial progress towards meeting the Department of Treasury's mandate to discontinue suspense accounts by\nFebruary 2009.\nWorked with staff to reduce reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in\nexperienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.\nI orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS\nOmaha to Limestone.\nAfter transition to Limestone encouraged staff responsible for these reports to streamline the processes.\nStaff automated a completely manual, time consuming process, thus eliminating potential key stroke errors and manually validating numerous\nspreadsheets and listings.\nContributor to Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) Compliance Review and establishment of assessable units.\nIdentified inconsistencies in information provided by staff on

consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard\nworkload.\nWorkload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.\nI also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes\nnegatively impacted our customers.\nIn December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.\nBy working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy\nthat included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of \"must pay now\" bills, and the formation of\nspecial action

these issues.\nUtilizing my expertise with Louis II data retrieval software, I produced ad-hoc data queries for in-house and external use by our customers.\nThese retrievals were designed to reduce the man- hours necessary to perform complex finance and accounting functions by DFAS and Air\nForce personnel.\nI was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.\nIn this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the\nmost cost efficient operation possible.\nI was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited to, vendors, DFAS management, accounting\nliaison offices, resource advisors, and other DFAS field sites.\nThese inquiries required my ability to relay technical aspects of systems deficiencies to customers who are not familiar with our operation.\nI participated in video teleconferences, conference calls, and briefings designed to address customer and DFAS management requirements.\nI was called upon to explain, in laymen's terms, DFAS policy and procedures with regards to delays in payment due to various reasons.\nI

TECHNICALS SKILLS:\nProgramming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0\/3.5\/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio\n2008\/2010\/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005\/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,\nCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)\nLEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is\nalso used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project\nwas to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding\nadditional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on\ncertain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.\nUBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee\nid, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will\ndecide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception\nrecords. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)\nSupplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of\nseven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can\naccess required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the\nmain communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL\nServer 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two\nparties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The\nexisting process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and\napproval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to\ncapture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to\nvalidate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a\nweb based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an\nability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk\ndata into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data\nthat can be uploaded into each column.

All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed\ndesign specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design\/develop\/testing phases, the implementing of database systems\nusing Classic ASP\/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000\/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux\nHosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key\nASP.Net\/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software.\nClients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.\nIntranet Application Support Analyst Jan 2003 to Jul 2007 \nCompany Name Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private\nlabel and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that\nparameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers\nthat arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful\nimplementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives\nsuch as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface\nand make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during\npeak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT\nteams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k\/Oracle 9i\ninfrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production\nenvironment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the\nsystem to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%\ncompliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and\napproval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements\/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within\nthe scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run\nteam was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing\nmaintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow\nfor a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management\nLeadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which\nI filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus\non and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague.\nImplemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure\nof the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to\n7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be\ncompleted within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10\n- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of\nknowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain\nbusiness functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.\nEducation\nBachelor's , Computer Information Systems DeVry University \u00ef\u00bc\u200b City , State , US 9\/2000 - 6\/2004 DeVry University, Alpharetta, Georgia\nBachelor's Degree, Computer Information Systems Academic Honors: Dean's List, Hope Scholarship GPA 3.46 while working and attending\nschool full-time\nAffiliations\nGivingBack Foundation, Inc\nCertifications\nSix Sigma Green Belt Certified\nSkills\nMarketing, Operations, Database, Asp, Ms Sql Server, Sql, Sql Server, Technical Support, Testing, Asp.net, Budget, Clients, Database Systems,\nLife Cycle, Linux, Ms Asp, Ms Sql Server 2000, Mysql, Online Solutions, Php, Project Launch, Solutions, Sql Server 2000, System\nDevelopment, Closer, Media Strategy, Networking, Online Marketing, Bank Card, Collections, Credit, Data Migration, Receivables, Intranet,\nMaintenance, Application Support, Archiving, Data Management, Subject Matter Expert, Work Flow, Business Requirements, Engineer, Finance,\nGraphical User Interface, Increase, Kronos, Load Balancing, Offshore, Oracle, Payroll, Production Environment, User Interface, Belt Certified,\nBlack Belt, Six Sigma, Six-sigma, .net, Associate, Client\/server, Coding, Css, Customer Service, Database Management, Detail Oriented, Dhtml,\nFlash, Frontpage, Html, Javascript, Microsoft Sql Server, Microsoft Sql Server 2000, Minitab, Ms Office, Photoshop, Project Management,\nReceptionist, Retail Sales, Self Motivated, Software Development, Structured Software, Team Player, Test Plans, Time & Attendance, Time And\nAttendance, Visual Studio, Xml\n",
